## Step 1 â€” Read the rules

Before joining, make sure you agree with our core principles:

1. **Daily commitment:** \~1 hour of ethical hacking / pentesting every day for 100 days.
2. **Share your work:** Post a daily check-in using `DAY-TEMPLATE.md`.
3. **Weekly write-up:** Publish one sanitized blog post or longer write-up each week.
4. **Ethics first:** Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission for. No exceptions.

## Step 2 â€” Sign the pledge

Copy/paste the pledge below into Discord `#onboarding`:

> I pledge to practice ethical pentesting for at least 1 hour daily for the next 100 days. I will only test systems I own or have permission for, and I will follow the Code of Conduct.

## Step 3 â€” Set up your participant folder

1. Go to the `participants/` directory.
2. Create a folder named after your username (e.g., `participants/alice/`).
3. Copy `DAY-TEMPLATE.md` â†’ `day-01.md` inside your folder.
4. Fill it out with your Day 1 log.
5. Commit and push.

Example:

```
participants/
  â””â”€â”€ ron/
      â”œâ”€â”€ day-01.md
      â”œâ”€â”€ day-02.md
      â””â”€â”€ ...
```
