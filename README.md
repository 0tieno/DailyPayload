# DailyPayload - 100DaysOfCyb3r

Welcome to DailyPayload! We’re committing to 100 consecutive days of practical, ethical hacking - pentesting.

start date: 15/09/2025 - 

> GOAL: I will practice ethical pentesting for at least 1 hour daily for the next 100 days, and publish a sanitized weekly write-up and one polished portfolio piece at the end.

we have 3 basic rules:
- At least 1hr a day of learning/hacking
- Daily share my learning. See here how to: [ONBOARDING.md](https://github.com/0tieno/DailyPayload/blob/main/ONBOARDING.md)
- Write at least 1 blog post at the end of each week
